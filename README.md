# Tic-Tac-Toe
Code with the final goal of a tic-tac-toe game where the computer plays the user.

With the end goal in mind, the first step was to develop code in which two users can play each other at tic-tac-toe. 

In this first step, a list was used to manipulate the board. The next iteration of the code introduced numpy arrays as a way of hadling the baord which was more straightforward and efficient.

The part which is now **in progress** is the introduction of classes and next the use of reinforcement learning to enable the computer to play the user.
